      Being developer it looks quite fancy of modifying the text file using the command line tools such as vim,nano etc. But When i started working on command line text editors it was quite annoying at first. I tried multiple time to work with cli but duo to not having enough knowledge of shortcut keys i was like handicapped and have to go back to my old friends (Ui text editors) .

      For any of the rest application it’s state has to be serialize or deserialized while transferring back and forth between application and the network. Spray-json provide such support for the json based state representation. For using spray-json we just need to add &lsquo;spray-json&rsquo; dependency in the project. For instance adding support in the sbt project add following to the build file. &quot;io.spray&quot; %% &quot;spray-json&quot; % &quot;1.3.2&quot; spray-json provides JsonFormater to serialize/deserialize all of the scala types.

      Customizing Angular Directives While developing Angular Application we have a obvious choice of using third party directives. Most of the time these directive are suffice to handle all the use cases. But situation may occur when you feel that there is really something missing to fulfill your Specific problem. Common practice is to add your own custom directive along with the directive, you want to use in the element. But It sounds quite weird to Have two directives to solve the same problem.

      Progressively Uploading CSV Scenario You may have encountered situations, when you need to send huge amount of data (in GBs ) to the server. One example is upload of large files. While sending this data, your server has to slog through the upcoming mighty request body and eventually process it. Problem Definition So this whole process is about getting chunk of data, wait for next chunk to come and then wait again and this goes on until it receives whole request body.

      Spray is a suite of lightweight Scala libraries providing client- and server-side REST/HTTP support on top of Akka. Akka makes the application fully asynchronous. There are other frameworks build on top of Akka such as Play that gives ability to build full web application but with one down side and that is application becomes highly coupled with the framework as the application build on top of Play. As oppose to that spray gives ability to create Application layer independent of anything without even thinking of the framework.
